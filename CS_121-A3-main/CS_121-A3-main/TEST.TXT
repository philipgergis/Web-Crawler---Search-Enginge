Bad
1. "ics uci" In this query search, the original contents were of a lot of documents that just looked for high term frquency. However, by adding the idf
	we significantly imporved the ranking, showing less documents and more relevant results. 
2. "computer science" In the original results, the page was full of niche pages on the ics domain that strayed from general computer science. After adding the idf
	portion our code narrowed down on more relative pages and functioned better overall.
3. "cs" Originally, most of the websites that showed up were documents with many css files written inside of them. Now with our completed tf-idf ranking, the number
	of documents was reduced significantly and shows more relative sites to the search.
4. "donald bren" Originally showed less pages that focused on the school of donald bren, but now by adjusting our ranking with the idf the results show more relevant 
	pages than before
5. "information science" The query search first showed random classes for informatics, but after finding a bug in our calculation that limited the results we fixed the 
	results shown.
6. "thornton" Originally relative pages on professor Thornton were shown later, but now they are closer to the top by completing and adjusting our idf portion of our
	tf-idf rating.
7. "software engineering" The major for software engineering was not shown close to the top prior to our calculation fix for our tf-idf function, but now the websites
	containing info on the major are relatively higher. 
8. "testing" The first set of results contained several pages or documents that only briefly mentioned testing, but our bug fix to our calculations in our ranking made it so 
	unit testing results are more common.
9. "boolean" The 6B class pages for boolean logic are now shown higher up than before due to our fix in our tf-idf ranking, specifically the idf portion.
10. "script" Was originally solely random files in the search, but after the fix to our tf-idf ranking there are less files and more relative urls.
