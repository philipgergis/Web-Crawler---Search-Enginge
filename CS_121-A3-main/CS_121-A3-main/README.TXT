# Project Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up and running your project, which consists of a frontend Vite.js TypeScript React project and a backend TypeScript React project.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js (version 18+)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Frontend Setup

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the frontend directory of this project.
2. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Once the dependencies are installed, you can build and run the frontend by running the following command:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   This command will start the development server for the frontend project.

## Backend Setup

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the backend directory of your project.
2. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Once the dependencies are installed, you need to build the index. To index the data run the following command. Ensure the data folder is in the backend folder.
   ```
   npm run index
   ```
4. After the build is complete, you can start the backend web server by running the following command:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Running the Project

To start the web interface, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the frontend directory of your project.
3. Run the following command:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the frontend development server.
4. Access the web interface by opening a web browser and entering the URL provided by the development server. Typically, it will be something like `http://localhost:5173/`.
